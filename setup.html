                    However If you are playing on LAN partys or at crowded areas, we strongly recommend closed headphones In that scenarios</p>

                <div class="topic"><h3>Onboard audio:</h3><br>
                <p>Onboard audio delivers the sound you hear direcly from your PC, this Is the most common setup.<br> Today most motherboards onboard audio do the job for many headphones.<br>
                    For most users & gamers onboard audio will serve you well.<br> If you don't get the volume you wan't even when It's turned 100%, you need an amplifier.</p><br>
                <h4 class="proscons">Downsides for Onboard audio:</h4><br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>No analog volume control</li>
                                        <li>Not giving enough volume for powerhungry headphones</li>
                                    </ul><br><br>
                                <h3>External audio:</h3><br>
                                <p>External audio takes the digital signal from your PC and converts It to analog externaly, also called DAC. Keep in mind that DAC and amplifier are 2 diffrent things, both are required so we human can hear the sound.
                                    But most External audio devices has both DAC and amplifier inclueded in one device, usually called: DAC & Amp combo.<br>
                                    In short term, audio Is handled outside from PC.<br>
                                    For gaming however, external audio can give some benifit in some senerios, ex. manual volume control and getting enough power depening on what headphones you use. Buying a External DAC & Amp Is expensive, around 200$ and up.
                                    It can be waste of money for some users. We only recommend buying external audio If you love audio and want High-End equipment.

                <div class="topic"><h3>Why Software?</h3><br>
                                <p>Do you need software to get better audio performance? Answer Is no.</p><br>
                                <p>Often some audio software that comes included can degrade your listening experience. Cheap headphones might benifit using software but for high-end headphones It should be turned off. Only exception Is EQ setting that can benifit in some senerios.</p>
                                <p>Some softwares tend to have some audio-feature effects turned on by default. Which will deliver sound that It's not ment to for your headphones.</p>

                <div class="topic"><h3>Does Cables matter?</h3> <br>               
                                <p>Better quality cable can offer a range of benefits, but improved audio quality is not one of them. More rugged cable and connectors can be useful if you are regularly plugging and unplugging.</p><br>
                <h4>Analog cable myths:</h4><br>
                                <p>Now, it is true that back in the day, cheaper cables were made with less-than-ideal components and had fairly poor quality control. 
                                    When Monster cables hit the scene, people loved to bash how much they cost, but you did get a somewhat decent build quality to them for the investment, along with a lifetime warranty.
                                    But that was a long time ago, and nowadays you can get cables for dirt cheap that not only perform their function almost perfectly, but will also stand up to the test of time.</p><br>
                <h4>Digital cable myths:</h4><br>
                                <p>What about digital? The previous logic doesn't hold up at all. These damn things carry ones and zeros: while you might need a powered USB hub to get a signal over long distances, these cables either work or they don't.
                                    Premium USB or optical cabels will <strong>never</strong>improve sound quality.
