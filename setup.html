          <p>
            We recommend Open headphones when It comes to gaming, longer
            wear-time and delivers wider soundstage aka surround sound. However
            If you are playing on LAN events or at crowded areas, we strongly
            recommend closed headphones In that scenarios

          <h3 class="margin-top margin-bottom">Onboard audio:</h3>
          <p class="margin-bottom">
            Onboard audio delivers the sound you hear directly from your PC,
            this Is the most common setup.
            Today most motherboards onboard audio do the job for many
            headphones.
            For most users & gamers onboard audio will serve you well.
            If you don't get the volume you wan't even when It's turned 100%,
            you need an amplifier.
          </p>
          <h4 class="margin margin-bottom">Downsides for Onboard audio:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>No analog volume control</li>
            <li class="margin-bottom">
              Not giving enough volume for power-hungry headphones
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="margin-bottom">External audio:</h3>
          <p>
            External audio takes the digital signal from your PC and converts It
            to analog externally, also called DAC. Keep in mind that DAC and
            amplifier are 2 different things, both are required so we human can
            hear the sound. But most External audio devices has both DAC and
            amplifier included in one device, usually called: DAC & Amp
            combo.
            In short term, audio Is handled outside from PC.
            For gaming however, external audio can give some benefit in some
            scenarios, ex. manual volume control and getting enough power
            depending on what headphones you use. Buying a External DAC & Amp Is
            expensive, around 200$ and up. It can be waste of money for some
            users. We only recommend buying external audio If you love audio and
            want High-End equipment.

          <h3 class="margin-bottom">Why Software?</h3>
          <p class="margin-bottom">
            Do you need software to get better audio performance? Answer Is no.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often some audio software that comes included can degrade your
            listening experience. Cheap headphones might benefit using software
            but for high-end headphones It should be turned off. Only exception
            Is EQ setting that can benefit in some scenarios.
          </p>
          <p class="margin-top">
            Some softwares tend to have some audio-feature effects turned on by
            default. Which can effect sound quality a lot for your headphones.

          <h3 class="margin-bottom">Does Cables matter?</h3>
          <p>
            Better quality cable can offer a range of benefits, but improved
            audio quality is not one of them. More rugged cable and connectors
            can be useful if you are regularly plugging and unplugging.
          </p>
          <h4 class="margin-bottom margin-top">Analog cable myths:</h4>
          <p>
            Now, it is true that back in the day, cheaper cables were made with
            less-than-ideal components and had fairly poor quality control. When
            Monster cables hit the scene, people loved to bash how much they
            cost, but you did get a somewhat decent build quality to them for
            the investment, along with a lifetime warranty. But that was a long
            time ago, and nowadays you can get cables for dirt cheap that not
            only perform their function almost perfectly, but will also stand up
            to the test of time.
          </p>
          <h4 class="margin-bottom margin-top">Digital cable myths:</h4>
          <p>
            What about digital? The previous logic doesn't hold up at all. These
            damn things carry ones and zeros: while you might need a powered USB
            hub to get a signal over long distances, these cables either work or
            they don't. Premium USB or optical cables will
            <strong>never</strong>improve sound quality.
